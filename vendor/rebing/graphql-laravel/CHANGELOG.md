2019-08-05, 2.0.0
-----------------
## Breaking changes
- The `UploadType` now has to be added manually to the `types` in your schema if you want to use it
  - The `::getInstance()` method is gone
- The order and arguments/types for resolvers has changed:
  - before: `resolve($root, $array, SelectFields $selectFields, ResolveInfo $info)`
  - after: `resolve($root, $array, $context, ResolveInfo $info, Closure $getSelectFields)`
- Added PHP types / phpdoc to all methods / properties [\#331](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/331)
  - Changes in method signatures will require small adaptions.
- Validation errors are moved from error.validation to error.extensions.validation as per GraphQL spec recommendation [\#294](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/294)
- SelectFields on interface types now only selects specific fields instead of all [\#294](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/294)
  - Although this could be consider a bug fix, it changes what columns are selected and if your code as a side-effect dependent on all columns being selected, it will break

### Added
- Added support for lazy loading types (config `lazyload_types`), improve performance on large type systems [\#405](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/405) but doens't work together with type aliases or `paginate()`.
- A migration guide for the Folklore library as part of the readme
- New `make:graphql:input` command
- New `make:graphql:union` command
- New `make:graphql:interface` command
- New `make:graphql:field` command
- New `make:graphql:enum` command and dedicated `EnumType`, deprecating `$enumObject=true` in the `Type` class
- New `make:graphql:scalar` command and add more information regarding scalars to the readme
- `TypeConvertible` interface requiring to implement `toType(): \GraphQL\Type\Definition\Type`
  Existing types are not affected because they already made use of the same method/signature, but custom Scalar GraphQL types work differently and benefit from the interface
- `alias` is now also supported for relationships [\#367](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/367)
- `InputType` support class which eventually replace `$inputObject=true` [\#363](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/363)
- Support `DB::raw()` in `alias` fields
- GraphiQL: use regenerated CSRF from server if present [\#332](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/332)
- Internal
  - Added declare(strict_types=1) directive to all files
  - Test suite has been refactored and now features Database (SQLite) tests too

### Changed
- Types and Schemas are now only booted when the `graphql` service is requested, improving performance when having this library installed but not using it in certain workloads (pure artisan commands, non-GraphQL web requests, etc.) [\#427](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/427)
- Follow Laravel convention and use plural for namspaces (e.g. new queries are placed in `App\GraphQL\Queries`, not `App\GraphQL\Query` anymore); make commands have been adjusted
- Made the following classes _abstract_: `Support\Field`, `Support\InterfaceType`, `Support\Mutation`, `Support\Query`, `Support\Type`, `Support\UnionType` [\#357](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/357)
- Updated GraphiQL to 0.13.0 [\#335](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/335)
  - If you're using CSP, be sure to allow `cdn.jsdelivr.net` and `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
- `ValidatorError`: remove setter and make it a constructor arg, add getter and rely on contracts
- Replace global helper `is_lumen` with static class call `\Rebing\GraphQL\Helpers::isLumen`

### Fixed
- The Paginator correctly inherits the types model so it can be used with `SelectFields` and still generates correct SQL queries [\#415](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/415)
- Arguments are now validated before they're passed to `authorize()` [\#413](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/413)
- File uploads now correctly work with batched requests [\#397](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/397)
- Path multi-level support for Schemas works again [\#358](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/358)
- SelectFields correctly passes field arguments to the custom query [\#327](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/327)
  - This also applies to privacy checks on fields, the callback now receives the field arguments too
  - Previously the initial query arguments would be used everywhere

### Removed
- Removed `\Fluent` dependency on `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Field` [\#431](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/431)
- Removed `\Fluent` dependency on `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type` [\#389](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/389)
- Unused static field `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type::$instances`
- Unused field `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type::$unionType`
